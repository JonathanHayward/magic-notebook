I only got through chapter 5 of George MacDonald's <em>Phantastes</em> before I had to return it, but it seems interesting, and the beech tree passage in chapter 5 is especially worth rereading.

"MagicNotebook10306448831238591213" "Scratch Pad" "I've noticed that I seem to be able to concentrate longer, and do better with, tasks that I want to do during leisure than those I do at work.

The claim, \"He can do it if he wants to\" usually has the insulting meaning of \"He can do it if he chooses, and the only reason he's doing badly is that he isn't trying.\" I've been thinking about this, and wondering if it might be true in a very different way: wanting to do something gives power. It gives long concentration and a more intense focus, and you <em>can</em> do things if you want to, that you <em>can't</em> if you don't.

This could mean that I will make more progress at work by focusing on wanting to do the task than by putting more willpower into things I don't want to do." "show" "MagicNotebook10306396982128624914"
"MagicNotebook1030645148973372728" "My Cool Programming Project (MCPP)" "When MCPP is running, the main window will be broken into three subwindows:

A state window, allowing the user to see and manipulate the program's internal state.
A command window, from which to give commands in MCPP's language, and
An output window, in which the results of commands may be seen.

Most programs have some equivalent of command and output, and you give a command to produce output--which is good in most aspects, but not for MCPP. The neglected internal state will be very interesting.

MCPP is <em>not</em> an AI program, in the sense of something meant to have intelligence in itself. It is meant to function as a cognitive artifact--something that doesn't compete with human intelligence but allows human intelligence to move with amplified power.

MCPP should be able to run on any computer running TOSTDS." "show expand " "MagicNotebook1030637077454397510"
